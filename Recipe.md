The recipe is:
Preheat oven to 350° and line two 9” round cake pans with parchment paper. Grease with cooking spray. In a large bowl, prepare cake mix according to package instructions. Divide between pans and bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cake cool completely. 
Using a serrated knife, level the rounded top of each cake until flat. Place one cake in the bottom of an 8" springform pan. Top with ice cream and smooth ice cream with an offset spatula until smooth. Top ice cream with second cake. 
Freeze cake until ice cream has hardened, about 2 hours. 
Meanwhile, make ganache: Put chocolate chips in a large heat-proof bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring heavy cream to simmer. Remove from heat and pour over chocolate chips. Let sit 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Let cool slightly. 
Remove cake from springform pan and pour ganache over top of cake. Garnish with sprinkles and serve immediately.
